# SignalK Guide - MOVED

This content has been moved to the shared skills repository.

## New Location

**Repo:** [dougkimmerly/claude-skills](https://github.com/dougkimmerly/claude-skills)
**Skill:** `signalk-expert`

## How to Access

### PM (Web Claude)
```

```

## Why Moved?

The signalk-guide is now a shared skill that:
- All SignalK orchestrators can use (signalk55, powernet, navnet, signalkDS)
- Accumulates learnings across all sessions
- Follows Anthropic's skill format for progressive disclosure
